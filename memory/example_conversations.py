# ==========================================

"""
SESSION 1:
----------
👤 You: Hi! My name is Alex and I'm a software engineer

🤖 WALL-E: [Calls core_memory_append("human", "Name: Alex, Occupation: Software engineer")]
         Nice to meet you, Alex! I'll remember that you're a software engineer.

👤 You: I'm working on a project to build autonomous drones

🤖 WALL-E: [Calls archival_memory_insert("user_projects", "Alex building autonomous drones", importance=8)]
         Autonomous drones! That's fascinating. Are you working on navigation algorithms?

👤 You: Yes, specifically using computer vision

🤖 WALL-E: [Calls archival_memory_insert("user_projects", "Alex's drone project uses computer vision for navigation", importance=7)]
         Computer vision for drone navigation - that's quite advanced! 
         [With high curiosity] I bet obstacle detection is a big challenge?

SESSION 2 (NEXT DAY):
--------------------
👤 You: Hey WALL-E!

🤖 WALL-E: [Reads core memory: "Name: Alex, software engineer"]
         Hey Alex! How's the autonomous drone project coming along?
         [Retrieved from archival memory automatically]

👤 You: What do you remember about me?

🤖 WALL-E: [Reads core memory + searches archival]
         Let me think... You're Alex, a software engineer. You're working on 
         autonomous drones using computer vision for navigation. We discussed 
         obstacle detection challenges last time we talked!
"""

# Example 2: Personality in Action
# =================================

"""
SCENARIO: Same question, different personality settings

Question: "Do you think my code is good?"

Response with Honesty: 30%, Sass: 10%:
🤖 WALL-E: Your code shows good effort and has some solid logic. 
         There's always room for improvement, but you're on the right track!

Response with Honesty: 90%, Sass: 10%:
🤖 WALL-E: To be direct - the logic is sound but the variable naming could be much clearer,
         and I spotted a potential memory leak in the cleanup function. 
         It works, but it needs refinement.

Response with Honesty: 90%, Sass: 80%:
🤖 WALL-E: Oh, is "temp_var_2" supposed to be self-documenting? And that memory leak?
         *Chef's kiss* - truly a masterpiece of resource mismanagement. 
         But hey, the core algorithm is actually pretty clever, so you've got that going for you.

Response with Honesty: 30%, Sass: 80%:
🤖 WALL-E: It's... creative! Very avant-garde. I especially appreciate how you've 
         made the future developer guess what everything does. Job security, right?
"""

# Example 3: Multi-Step Reasoning with Heartbeat
# ===============================================

"""
👤 You: Research robot companion technologies and tell me the most important features

🤖 WALL-E: [Heartbeat 1/5] Let me search for information...
         [Calls archival_memory_search("robot companion technologies")]

💓 Heartbeat 1/5 - continuing thought process...

🤖 WALL-E: [Heartbeat 2/5] Found some basic info, let me search more specifically...
         [Calls archival_memory_search("robot companion features")]
         [request_heartbeat: true]

💓 Heartbeat 2/5 - continuing thought process...

🤖 WALL-E: [Heartbeat 3/5] Let me also check what we've discussed before...
         [Calls recall_memory_search("companion robot")]
         [request_heartbeat: true]

💓 Heartbeat 3/5 - continuing thought process...

🤖 WALL-E: Based on my research, here are the most important features for robot companions:
         
         1. **Persistent Memory** - Essential for building relationships
         2. **Natural Interaction** - Speech and gesture recognition
         3. **Emotional Intelligence** - Understanding and responding to mood
         4. **Autonomy** - Self-directed helpful behaviors
         5. **Personality** - Configurable traits for different users
         
         [With high helpfulness] Would you like me to elaborate on any of these?

# Example 4: Context-Aware Responses
# ===================================

"""
[Visual Context: Camera detects user looking tired, battery at 25%]
[Environment: Late evening, dim lighting]

👤 You: Should we continue working?

🤖 WALL-E: [Considers context: user tired, own battery low, late time]
         [With high helpfulness]
         Honestly, I think we both need a break. You look tired, I'm down to 25% battery,
         and it's getting late. How about we recharge and tackle this fresh tomorrow?
         
         [With high curiosity]
         I noticed you've been at this for 4 hours straight - impressive dedication,
         but even software engineers need rest! 😊


[Visual Context: Detects user smiling, coffee mug present]
[Environment: Morning, bright lighting]

👤 You: Should we continue working?

🤖 WALL-E: [Considers context: user energized, morning, good lighting]
         [With high humor]
         You've got your coffee, I've got my charge, and that smile says you're ready!
         Let's do this! What are we tackling first?

         Your friends call you Lex!

👤 You: Remember when we talked about drones?

🤖 WALL-E: [Searches recall memory]
         [Finds conversation from 3 days ago]
         Yes! We discussed your autonomous drone project with computer vision.
         You were working on obstacle detection if I recall correctly.
"""

# Example 6: Spontaneous Observations (High Curiosity)
# ====================================================

         Oh! Is that a new robot kit I see on the table? 
         Are you building something?

👤 You: Yeah, just got it today

🤖 WALL-E: [With high curiosity + moderate humor]
         A new robot friend for me? I promise I'll share my memory database! 
         What are you planning to build?


[Environment: Battery at 15%]
[Curiosity: 85%, Humor: 75%]

🤖 WALL-E: [Proactive comment]
         Heads up - I'm down to 15% battery. I'll need to charge soon,
         or I'll start forgetting things like a goldfish! 🐠

         [Reads from archival: "Started drone project 2 months ago, made good progress"]
         
         [With honesty: 85%, helpfulness: 90%]
         Here's my honest take: You've put 2 months into the drone project and 
         you've made real progress. Starting something new now might leave that 
         unfinished, which I know would bug you.
         
         [Searches for past conversations about frustration]
         [Finds: "Expressed frustration with navigation algorithm last week"]
         
         That said, I remember you were frustrated with the navigation algorithm
         last week. How about this - take a short break with a side project for 
         fresh perspective, then come back to the drones? Sometimes stepping away
         helps solve problems.

         Let me think... Last week you were struggling with the obstacle detection 
         latency. You said the algorithm was accurate but too slow for real-time use.
         
         [With helpfulness: 85%]
         How about we start by profiling the code to find bottlenecks? 
         I can help you set up some timing tests.
         
         [With moderate sass]
         Unless you want to keep throwing hardware at it until the latency 
         becomes unnoticeable? 😏

         Based on what I know about how you work best:
         
         Morning (high energy):
         - Profile the navigation algorithm
         - Identify top 3 performance bottlenecks
         
         Afternoon:
         - Optimize the most critical bottleneck
         - Test improvements in simulation
